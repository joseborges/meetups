        <p class="mt-10">
            Hey there! We’d be thrilled if you joined us as a speaker at PHP Portugal #12! We’ve already snagged one awesome speaker, <a href="https://twitter.com/dianaarnos" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 font-bold">Diana Arnos</a>, but we’ve got room for another.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-10">
            The talk slot duration is around 20 minutes, and it’s totally up to you how advanced the talk is! Trust me, people love even the more introductory talks. Anyway, drop your talk idea below, and I will let you know if you get selected.
        </p>
